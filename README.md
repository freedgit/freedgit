# Smallest possible FAQ about me.

## Who am I

F. Reed, developer-turned-devops-turned-developer.

## Interests

Operating systems internals, Devops tooling, hypervisors, infrastructure as code, C 
and scripting programming. Kind of a UNIX historian. I also dig Emacs and the X Window System (yes, even in 2022.)

I also enjoy alternative operating systems (such as Windows.)

There are many other interests inside and outside computing, the major one being linguistics.

## Currently learning

... kubernetes alternatives and time-series databases.

## What can I help you with

Architecting systems and companies (yes I had some experience on both fronts.)

## How to reach out

Send me a pull request or mention me.
